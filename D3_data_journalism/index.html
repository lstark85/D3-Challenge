          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>Household Income plays a role with health risks. For the majority of lower income households, there is a higher 
            rate for obesity and smokers. However it is interesting to see that lack of healthcare remains fairly consistent
            despite the median income.</p>

          <p>It is also interesting to see how Poverty plays a role with health risks. Those who are in poverty range consistently
            for obesity. About 12% and more are smokers. Also, those that are in poverty have between 6 and 20% that lack healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>Finally, how does age become a factor for health risks? The median age ranges between 33 and 40 years of age. The obesity
            rate is between 22% or higher in this age group. With 13% or higher being smokers. </p>
